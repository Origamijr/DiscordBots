Shounen	The first Captain Tsubasa movie is about a match between an "All Europe Boy Soccer Team" and an "All Japan Boy Soccer Team" and takes place at the end of the first TV series.

Shounen	In the course of the match Hyuga manages to perfect his Tiger Shot and joins the team.
Shounen	With those legendary players united and Hyugas new power they manage to defeat their opponent 4:3 in the last minutes.

Shounen	In the fourth movie, the classical Japan-Europe match becomes intercontinental.
Shounen	This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, "All Europe", and "All South America".
Shounen	In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America.
Shounen	In the final round S.A. shows their "soccer cyborg" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable.

Shounen	The last Captain Tsubasa movie is about the match between Japan and Holland.
Shounen	After the Japanese team lost two games against this apparently supreme opponent, their confidence is at its lowest point and even Hyuga, having a hurt leg, is desperate.
Shounen	Thus the management tries everything to convince Wakabayashi (living in Germany) and Tsubasa (living in Brazil) to come to Holland and to help them, but both deny.
Shounen	Only in the second half of the third game Tsubasa appears and joins the team, giving them back their confidence and strength.
Shounen	With Tsubasa Ozora as their captain again, the last game ends 11:1 for Japan.

Seinen	This special is a recap of the first season of Eikoku Koi Monogatari Emma: Intermission as well as a preview of the second season Eikoku Koi Monogatari Emma: Molders Hen.
Seinen	Based on a seinen manga by Kikuchi Naoe and Yokomi Hirohiko, serialised in IKKI.
Seinen	The "story" is that a manga artist is asked by her boss to accompany him and a travel-writer on various train trips around Japan and draw a manga about it.
Seinen	The kicker though, is that it's completely non-fiction —the creator really did go on all these trips, and the manga simply records what happened, with no embellishment.
Seinen	There's a little disclaimer at the front that says "This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama," and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc.
Seinen	The "travel writer" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second.
Seinen	He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g.
Seinen	visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains).
Seinen	The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining.
Seinen	Throughout, though, it feels real —if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel— and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining.
Seinen	In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga!
Seinen	In addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool.
Seinen	There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed.
Seinen	You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence.

Seinen	Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard.
Seinen	Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it.

Shoujo	Patarillo!
Shoujo	is set in a society much like ours in most ways, with one decided twist.
Shoujo	The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys).
Shoujo	Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas.
Shoujo	The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series.
Shoujo	They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself.
Shoujo	The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it.
Shoujo	In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran.
Shoujo	Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood.
Shoujo	The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination.
Shoujo	This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself.
Shoujo	The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same.
Shoujo	(MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.)

Shoujo	The Guardian Characters accomplish this by giving encouragement and advice, but they can also temporarily change a person's personality and abilities.
Shoujo	With the Guardian Characters, Amu's life becomes much more complex as she now struggles to deal with her new personalities and the Seiyo Elementary Guardians—a student council group where each member has their own Guardian Character—who recruits Amu to search for and seal the X eggs and X Characters, corrupted forms of people's dreams.

Shoujo	Patarillo!
Shoujo	is set in a society much like ours in most ways, with one decided twist.
Shoujo	The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys).
Shoujo	Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas.
Shoujo	The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series.
